            <p>Studio Ghibli, Inc. (Japanese: 株式会社スタジオジブリ, Hepburn: Kabushiki gaisha Sutajio Jiburi) is a Japanese animation studio based in Koganei, Tokyo. It has a strong presence in the animation industry and has expanded its portfolio to include various media formats, such as short subjects, television commercials, and two television films. Their work has been well-received by audiences and recognized with numerous awards. Their mascot and most recognizable symbol, the character Totoro, is a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (tanuki) and cats from the 1988 film My Neighbor Totoro.</p>
            <p>My name is Joy, for the subject Internetstandaarden i had to create my first website with HTML and CSS. I was wondering for quite some time what subject i had to make my site about. I was looking at all the things i like, then it hit me, Studio Ghibli! My interest with Studio Ghibli began when i was around the age of 8 years old, i remember watching Spirited away and being really scared and i never wanted to watch it again. However, later in my teenage years i started to watch more films and this is where my love for Studio Ghibli started. What i like about these movies is the animation, storyline and music, it all comes together so well! I hope you enjoy learning a little about Studio Ghibli. Much love, Joy</p>
