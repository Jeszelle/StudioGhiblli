              <h2>My Neighbor Totoro.</h2>
              <p>
                Set in 1950s Japan, My Neighbour Totoro is the story of young sisters Satsuki and Mei whose father moves them to an old house to be closer to the hospital where their mother is recovering from a long-term illness. The girls quickly discover that their new residence and the surrounding areas are home to friendly forest spirits, particularly a large rabbit-like creature that Mei names Totoro. Towards the end of the movie, Mei goes missing is rescued with the help of Totoro and pals.

                Some fans believe the movie is a reference to the Sayama Incident which took place in Japan in 1963 and resulted in a high-profile criminal trial. Supposed links include the fact that the movie is set in Sayama, that the murder that became the crux of the event took place in the month of May and Satsuki's sister's name is Mei, and that one of the stops on the CatBus translates to “Grave Road.”

              <h2>Ghibli park</h2>
              <p>
                Ghibli Park (ジブリパーク) is a themepark about the popular animated movies by Studio Ghibli. It opened in November 2022 just outside Nagoya, and unlike other theme parks does not feature any rides, but rather lets visitors delve into the atmospheric fantasy worlds presented in the various popular Ghibli movies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The theme park currently consists of four areas, and one more area, the Valley of Witches, will be added on March 16, 2024. The areas are not joined together, but found spread across the Expo 2005 Aichi Commemorative Park, the former site of the 2005 World Expo.
