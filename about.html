                    Hayao Miyazaki 宮崎駿
                </h2>
                <p>
                    January 5, 1941, Tokyo is a Japanese film director, producer, screenwriter, animator, author and manga artist. His breakthrough in the West was mainly due to the great success of Spirited Away, an animated film that was awarded "Best Animated Film" at the 75th Academy Awards in 2003. In Japan the film was so popular that it displaced the film Titanic from the top spot. Miyazaki's films are characterized by the music of Joe Hisaishi, with whom he has had a very good relationship and has worked with since his first films. Miyazaki announced at the 2013 Venice Film Festival that he would retire after the film The Wind Rises.

                    Background story
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Before that, all three worked at an animation studio called Topcraft which went bankrupt in 1985. Miyazaki and Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had worked together on Horus: Prince of the Sun (aka The Little Norse Prince Valiant) and Panda! Go, Panda!; and Suzuki was an editor at Tokuma Shoten's Animage manga magazine. 
                    They bought te company and changed the name to Studio Ghibli. The proceeds from the film Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind made the company's founding possible. Although this animated film was made before the studio was founded, it is still included in the repertoire.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The name Ghibli is derived from the nickname the Italians gave to the aircraft with which they carried out reconnaissance flights over the Sahara during the Second World War. This name in turn is derived from the Libyan wind that blows from south to north through the desert, similar to the sirocco. The reason why this name was chosen is because the studio wanted to breathe new life into the anime industry.
                    Although the Italian word is pronounced with a guttural /g/ as in the English word good , the studio's name begins with the Japanese letter /ji/, which is pronounced as in 'Jim'. This is basically a "mistake" by Hayao Miyazaki who came up with the name.

                <p>
                    Because the future of the studio was still uncertain in the early years, Takahata set several standards to keep the costs of developing the films as low as possible. For example, only part-time employees were hired and each team, which consisted of approximately seventy employees, was disbanded after completing each film. Meanwhile, costs were further reduced by renting only one floor in a building in Kichijoji, a suburb of Tokyo.

                    The studio's logo is Totoro, one of the best-known cartoon characters from the film My Neighbor Totoro hat was released in 1988. In Japan, Totoro also means Obake, which are shape-shifting creatures from Japanese folklore. Due to the great popularity of both the studio and the character Totoro, various marketing products featuring Totoro's image can be found throughout Japan, such as cuddly toys, toys and mobile phone straps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Totoros can also be found everywhere in the Studio Ghibli museum. There is a life-size specimen at the entrance and more are incorporated into the stained glass windows. In the stroboscopic merry-go-round you will find three that move and in the design room you can view not only preliminary designs for the film My Neighbor Totoro but also Totoro hair.
